Description: This plugin will allow the owner of the wordpress deployment to integrate community microlearning into their site.  This plugin embeds a Learnie Community into any wordpress space by using a shortcode like this: [Learnie id="MTYxMjIwODI0NjM3MQ=="], where id is the community ID from Learnie (you can find it on your web community config area.  This is located in the Learnie community builder admin section under the gear icon by selecting the "copy ID" button. 

Once you have configured your Learnie ID (accessible from your Learnie community at https://learnie.app/#/cohortcompanies) under the gear icon where you can "Copy ID", the community will automatically populate in your wordpress page. 

Users will be able to see the microlearning lessons in your community and you will be able to create content through the main app at https://learnie.app.
